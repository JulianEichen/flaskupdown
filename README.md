# flaskupdown
## Purpose
Little exercise project, to implement upload, representation, manipulation and download of a CSV-file.

## Understanding The App
### Important Frameworks

- Flask: main framework
- Jinja2: template engine
- pandas: CSV manipulation
- pytest: testing framework
- coverage: creation of the coverage report

## Structure

Absolute basic flask packaging structure, to use the blueprint feature and ease testing.

## Usage
### Running The App Locally 

Assuming we are using Linux and Python 3.10+ is installed, we can use the following commands in a terminal to download the repository, install the dependencies. 

```
git clone git@github.com:JulianEichen/flaskupdown.git
cd flaskupdown
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

We can now use
```
python3 run.py
```
and access the app in a browser under http://localhost:5000/

### Navigation

The homepage shows a default table, which can be sorted by clicking the buttons above it or downloaded by using the button below. It is also possible to upload a new file with the options to the right. 

## Testing
Basic functional pytest-Testing is provided, with the main goal to reach [100% code coverage](https://julianeichen.github.io/flaskupdown_coverage).
